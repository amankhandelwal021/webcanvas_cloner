    description: 'A complete e-commerce solution with integrated payment processing, inventory management, and customer analytics for a premium fashion retailer looking to expand their online presence.',
    challenge: 'FashionBrand was struggling with an outdated e-commerce platform that couldn\'t handle their growing inventory and was providing a poor mobile shopping experience. Cart abandonment was high at 76%, and they were unable to implement modern marketing features to increase conversions.',
    approach: 'We began with extensive user research to understand customer pain points and shopping behaviors. After creating detailed user personas and journey maps, we designed prototypes that were tested with actual customers. Our development process used agile methodologies with two-week sprints and regular client demos to ensure the solution evolved based on feedback.',
    solution: 'We developed a custom headless e-commerce platform built on React and Node.js with a MongoDB database. The solution included a responsive design optimized for mobile shoppers, an intelligent product recommendation engine, and a streamlined checkout process. The backend included robust inventory management with real-time stock updates across all sales channels.',
